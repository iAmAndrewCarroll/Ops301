[Resource: What is NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/)

**1. What are some common use cases for NGINX?**
- NGINX has several common use cases, including:
  - Web serving: It efficiently delivers web content, making it ideal for hosting websites and web applications.
  - Reverse proxying: NGINX acts as an intermediary between clients and web servers, enhancing security and performance.
  - Load balancing: It distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers to prevent overloads and ensure high availability.
  - Caching: NGINX caches content to reduce server load and improve response times.
  - Media streaming: It can handle streaming of various media formats like video and audio.

**2. How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?**
- NGINX handles tasks that might slow down a web server, such as SSL/TLS negotiation and content compression, efficiently by acting as an intermediary. It can serve as a reverse proxy and cache, offloading these tasks from the web server. This optimization reduces the workload on the server, making it more responsive to user requests.

**3. Describe, as if to a non-technical friend, how to actually pronounce “NGINX,” and why an organization might choose to use it.**
- NGINX is pronounced as "Engine-X." Think of it like saying "engine" with an "X" at the end. It's chosen by organizations because it's like the powerful engine that drives their websites and applications. Here's why they might use it:
  - Speed: NGINX is super fast, so websites load quickly and respond to users in a snap.
  - Efficiency: It helps websites handle lots of visitors without slowing down or crashing.
  - Security: NGINX adds a protective layer, like a shield, to keep websites safe from cyberattacks.
  - Balancing: It spreads out the work among many computers, like sharing chores, so websites stay up and running smoothly.
