### The OSI Model

**1. What does “OSI” stand for?**
   - OSI stands for "Open Systems Interconnection."

**2. List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for:**
   - The OSI model consists of seven layers:
     - **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Responsible for physical connections, synchronization of bits, transmission rate, physical topologies, and transmission modes.
     - **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Ensures error-free data transfer between nodes, framing, physical addressing (MAC addresses), error control, flow control, and access control.
     - **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Handles data transmission between hosts in different networks, routing, logical addressing (IP addresses), and selecting the best path for data transmission.
     - **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Provides end-to-end delivery of data segments, acknowledgment, error handling, segmentation, reassembly, and uses port numbers for communication.
     - **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections, synchronizes data, and controls dialog between systems.
     - **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Translates and manipulates data formats for transmission, including encryption, decryption, and compression.
     - **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Where network applications operate, producing data for transfer, offering access to the network, and displaying received information.

**3. Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?**
   - The hardware layers are often referred to as the "Lower Layers." They include:
     - **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Deals with the actual physical connections and transmission of bits.
     - **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Handles node-to-node delivery, including error control and access control.
   - The software layers are often called the "Upper Layers" or "Software Layers." They include:
     - **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Manages data transmission between hosts in different networks, routing, and logical addressing.
     - **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Ensures end-to-end delivery, segmentation, and reassembly, using port numbers for communication.
     - **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections, synchronization, and dialog control.
     - **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Deals with data format translation, encryption, decryption, and compression.
     - **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Houses network applications, producing data for transfer and providing access to the network.

**4. How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?**
   - The OSI model serves as a helpful framework for troubleshooting network issues. You can follow these steps:
     1. **Determine the Layer**: Identify which layer of the OSI model the problem likely originates from. For example, is it a physical connectivity issue (Layer 1) or a software application problem (Layer 7)?
     2. **Isolate the Problem**: Once you've pinpointed the layer, focus your troubleshooting efforts on that specific layer. This helps narrow down the potential causes.
     3. **Check Connectivity**: For lower layers (hardware), verify physical connections, cables, and devices. For upper layers (software), ensure that applications and protocols are configured correctly.
     4. **Use Tools**: Utilize network diagnostic tools, such as ping, traceroute, or packet analyzers, to gather data and identify issues.
     5. **Test Layer by Layer**: If necessary, test each layer sequentially, starting from the bottom, to identify where the problem occurs.
     6. **Solve the Issue**: Once the problem layer is identified, take appropriate actions to resolve it, whether it involves fixing hardware, adjusting configurations, or troubleshooting software.

The OSI model's layered approach helps in systematically diagnosing and resolving network problems by breaking down the complex network into manageable components.

### Wireshark

**1. What is Wireshark?**
   - Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that allows us to capture, inspect, and analyze network packets. It's a powerful tool used for understanding and troubleshooting network communication.

**2. What is a packet?**
   - A packet is a discrete unit of data in a network, typically used in Ethernet networks. It's like a small piece of information that gets sent over a network and contains data, along with header information that provides details about its source, destination, and other attributes.

**3. What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?**
   - Wireshark accomplishes three main tasks:
     - *Packet Capture:* Wireshark can capture real-time network traffic, including thousands of packets simultaneously. This capability could be misused for nefarious purposes like eavesdropping on sensitive data, monitoring network activities without permission, or launching attacks to gather information.
     - *Filtering:* Wireshark allows us to filter and focus on specific packets, making it easier to analyze and troubleshoot network issues. While this is crucial for network administrators in legitimate scenarios, it could also be misused for illegal surveillance or intrusion into private networks.
     - *Visualization:* Wireshark provides a detailed view of network packets, aiding in the visualization of conversations and streams. In benevolent scenarios, this helps troubleshoot network problems, optimize network performance, and ensure network security. However, malicious users could use this visualization to understand network vulnerabilities or launch attacks.

   It's essential to use Wireshark responsibly and within the bounds of ethical and legal guidelines. While it's a valuable tool for network professionals, misuse can lead to serious legal and ethical consequences.
