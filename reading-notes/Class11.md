[Resource: What's the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?](https://www.howtogeek.com/404763/whats-the-difference-between-windows-and-windows-server/)

**1. What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?**
- A server is like a specialized computer designed to manage and provide services to other computers over a network. Imagine your regular computer as a personal tool for everyday tasks, like writing documents and browsing the web. In contrast, a server is more like the behind-the-scenes workhorse in a theater. It handles tasks like storing and sharing files, managing user accounts, and hosting websites or applications that people access over the internet. So, while your computer is for personal use, a server is all about supporting and connecting multiple computers to perform specific tasks efficiently.

**2. How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?**
- Windows Server and Windows Home/Pro have different approaches to updates. Windows 10 Home and Pro receive frequent updates directly from Microsoft, including new features and security patches. Users have some control over when to install these updates.
  
  On the other hand, Windows Server prioritizes stability and reliability. It allows administrators to disable updates entirely through group policy, ensuring that the server's functionality remains consistent without unexpected changes. Updates for Windows Server are typically managed more carefully to minimize disruptions to critical services.

**3. Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?**
- Yes, Windows Server has different hardware requirements compared to Windows Home or Pro. Windows Server is designed to handle more robust workloads, so it supports higher-end hardware configurations. For example:
   
  - Windows Server can handle significantly more RAM, up to 24 TB, compared to Windows 10 Pro's maximum limit of 2 TB.
  - Windows Server supports a greater number of CPU sockets, up to 64, while Windows 10 Pro supports only two.
  - Windows Server has no limits on the number of CPU cores it can utilize, whereas Windows 10 has specific limits depending on the edition.

  These hardware capabilities make Windows Server suitable for managing multiple computers, running server applications, and handling high-demand tasks, whereas Windows 10 Home and Pro are optimized for typical personal computing needs.
