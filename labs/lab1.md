Why is network traffic analysis a relevant skill to have?
- Network traffic analysis is a relevant skill to have because it allows you to see what is happening on your network. It can help you identify malicious activity, such as a hacker trying to gain access to your network. It can also help you identify network issues, such as a misconfigured router or switch.

Do I see myself working in this type of job in the future?
- Yes.  I am going to do start a SoHo focused MSP that will harden and update networks for small businesses and large homes.
